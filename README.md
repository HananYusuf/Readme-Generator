## Installation
Steps required to install this project:To generate your own README, first run `npm -y` in order to install the dependencies as specified in the `package.json` then `npm i inquirer` that will prompt you for your inputs from the command line. 

## Usage 
When you run `node index.js`, the application uses the `inquirer` package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions about your project. Based on your response to the inquirer prompts the application then takes your responses and append it to the appropriate sections. Finally, `fs.writeFile` is used to generate your project's README.md file.
